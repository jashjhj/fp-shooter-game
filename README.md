Hi! This is my game.

Inspired by the likes of Reciever and Half Sword, I want this to be a game where you have to deal with the complexities of your own weapon and the internal systems of the enemies.

Operate your gun without messy keybinds, but with a point-and-click interface for intimate control!

Slow down time as you focus to take out core components of the robots!  Shoot its legs, break its knees, so it falls down, then you can get to the fleshy (metal) insides (batteries and motors) - or take out its cameras and motors, making it deaf, lame and blind!

I've put my physics and maths education to finally some good use, letting me build upon the engines own phsyics with ym heuristic physics to lead to dramatic, gratifying takedowns!

Feel free to give it a go with the Releases, and tell your friends about it!

(Current release is VERY outdated, shows only basic gun mechanics. VERY SOOM expect a small gladiator arena with robots to fight! - expected by ~13th july)
